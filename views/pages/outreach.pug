    div.panel-body
      p One of our goals as a team is to connect with our community through STEM. We do this by participating in various outreach events, where we demonstrate one of our robots and talk about what we do as a part of FIRST. Many of our team members enjoy volunteering at these events, and we love showing our community the results of our hard work!
      p If you wish to contact us, please email us at #[a(href='mailto:outreach@robototes.com') outreach@robototes.com]

        li Science fairs: We have participated in multiple Bellevue School District elementary school science fairs, including Lake Hills, Woodridge, Spiritridge, and Eastgate. For many, we have attended for over five years! At these events we get to show our robot to a crowd of amazed students and parents. We also inform many parents about FIRST and how kids at all grades can participate in it.
        li STEM fair: This was our fifth year participating in our high school’s STEM fair, an annual fair where employees of STEM organizations and experts in their fields gather to stimulate interest in high schoolers and the local community about their respective fields. Leading up to the fair, many of our members helped organize and run the STEM Fair. During the event, we demonstrated our competition robot and were even able to hang out with the University of Washington’s robotics team!
        li Stevenson robotics: This year we were lucky enough to be able to help out with Stevenson Elementary’s robotics program! Many of our students would walk there on Mondays, taking advantage of our meeting time to help volunteer. The Stevenson robotics  program has two hundred kids ranging from kindergarten to fifth grade, so two members of our team help different classes to ensure students get as much help as possible with the activities they are doing. At the end of each 8-week session, we bring our competition robots to showcase to kids.
        li Sammamish LEADS: This coming summer will be our fourth year involved in LEADS, a program that all current or new students of the Bellevue School District high schools are invited to attend. Last year, our team ran the seven-day summer program where we helped students build and program sumo robots. At the end of the week they competed in a round robin tournament like battle bots. Many of the students in this program end up joining our team!
